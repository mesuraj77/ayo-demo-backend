# ayo4u Convertor Demo

## Overview

The brief of the assignment was outlined as follows:
1. Create a Spring Boot application using rest APIâ€™s to do a conversions.
2. Convert Metric to imperial and vice versa. The API must cater for at least 5 conversions (include temperature conversion please).
3. Ensure that you have proper Unit and Integration testing that accompany the project.
4. Insomnia/Postman/Jmeter project with your RestAPI's.
5. Use the latest Angular to create a front end for your project. (Only if you have time)
6. Upload your project into your own GIT repository and share the project with us.
7. The project must be able to run in its own Docker environment
8. Build system must use Maven.

## Tech Stack
As per the brief, a Spring Boot application has been created using Maven for dependency management and as the build tool. 

Unit tests are implemented using JUnit5 with Mockito for unit tests, and a short-lived Spring Boot Test instance 
being spun up to facilitate integration testing by triggering all predefined endpoints.

The application has also been containerized by means of a <code>Dockerfile</code> located in the base directory. The
image can be built from the root directory (demo) using the <code>docker build .</code> command and specifying a tag of
your choice. The image can then be spun up using <code>docker run < your_tagged_image > </code> and will be exposed on 
port 8080 as per the <code>Dockerfile</code>. Alternatively you may use Docker Desktop to manage images and containers 
once the image is built and tagged.

A Postman collection has been specified which can be used to trigger all predefined endpoints. The file 
<code>ayo-convertor.postman.json</code> may be imported into Postman for testing purposes and includes two error test
cases to highlight the functionality to first time users.

## Solution

As per the requirements, a solution was designed that exposed a single REST API with multiple conversions between two 
known systems, namely metric and imperial.
The endpoint allows a user (by means of triggering a single endpoint) to convert to metric, or to imperial, by specifying
the desired system to convert to as a path variable. 

Further to this, the user may use the same endpoint to trigger conversions between different types of measurements by 
specifying the type on a different path variable. There are, as mentioned below, 5 units of measurement that may be
specified on the endpoint.

The measurements selected were:
1. Temperature - allowing conversions between Fahrenheit and Celsius
2. Area - allowing conversions between Acre and Hectare
3. Length - allowing conversions between Mile and Kilometer
4. Volume - allowing conversions between Gallon and Litre
5. Weight - allowing conversions between Pound and Kilogram

Should a user specify an unknown system or unknown measurement, the API will respond accordingly with an appropriate
error response code as well as an error message defining the issue and what are the possible solutions.

An example would be as follows: http://localhost:8080/convert/temperature/imperial/33.2 where <code>temperature</code> 
would be a known measurement, <code>33.2</code> degrees celsius would be the value to convert and <codee>imperial</code> 
would be  the system to convert the value into.

The application makes use of the <code>Convertor</code> interface which specifies all convertors must be able to convert
both to imperial and to metric. Each of the available services implement this interface and contains formulas to conduct
conversions.

All endpoints trigger the convertor method on <code>ConvertorService.java</code> which will then by means of the
<code>ConvertorFactory.java</code> inject the appropriate implementation of the <code>Convertor.java</code> interface.

### Considerations

I had played around with the idea of each service (where applicable) being able to convert between multiple different
units of measure. For example, being able to convert Weight from Imperial Pounds to Metric grams, as well as Metric
Kilograms etc.
This can be implemented by extending the Convertor to allow units to be specified and thereafter trigger the appropriate
conversion. 

I had considered implementing in this manner, but it seemed to be overkill for the brief and decided instead to opt for
a simplified solution to cater to just one unit of measurement per conversion.

## Notes
The formulas in the application have been implemented according to Google's Home Page conversion feature. Should you not
be satisfied with the conversions, please feel free to adjust accordingly in the appropriate service(s).
